###   So, what I want you to do is that whoever is accessing these files, please make sure that you run the transcriber.py file and ###
###   also the necessary libraries that have been imported has to be installed using PIP commands.   ###

So, basically what this transcriber.py does is that it makes use of the Whisper model and does the transcription by recording the audio snippet when you click on the start recording and once you click stop recording the data will give transcribe. By default it will be a "tiny" model which you can change into base model and necessary modifications or want can be done to the transcriber.py so that they can develop their own customized transcriber models.
