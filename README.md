###   So, what I want you to do is that whoever is accessing these files, please make sure that you run the transcriber.py file and also the necessary libraries that have been imported has to be installed using PIP commands.   ###

So, basically what this transcriber.py does is that it makes use of the Whisper model and does the transcription by recording the audio snippet when you click on the start recording and once you click stop recording the data will give transcribe. By default it will be a "tiny" model which you can change into base model and necessary modifications or want can be done to the transcriber.py so that they can develop their own customized transcriber models.

Perfect 👍 A **README.md** file is exactly the right place to document installation instructions.
Here’s a clean version you can directly use:

# 🎙️ Whisper Transcriber

This project provides a simple GUI for recording audio, transcribing it in real-time using **OpenAI Whisper**, and copying the transcribed text easily.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

### 1. Python

* Version: **Python 3.8 or higher**
* You can check your version with:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

### 2. Required Python Packages

Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install sounddevice numpy openai-whisper torch pyperclip
```

👉 For Linux users: You may also need `tkinter` separately:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## 📚 Library Details

Here’s what each library is used for:

* **tkinter** → GUI framework (usually comes pre-installed with Python, install via system package manager if missing)
* **sounddevice** → Recording audio from your microphone
* **numpy** → Handling audio data arrays
* **whisper** → Speech-to-text model (OpenAI Whisper)
* **torch** → PyTorch backend required for Whisper (uses GPU if available)
* **pyperclip** → Copying text to clipboard


```bash
pip install sounddevice
pip install numpy
pip install openai-whisper
pip install torch (please use the CUDA supported version)
pip install pyperclip

## ⚡ GPU Support (Optional but Recommended)

If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to use it for faster transcription:

1. Visit [PyTorch Installation Guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
2. Choose your CUDA version and run the suggested `pip` install command.

Example (for CUDA 11.8):

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

## 🚀 Running the Program

Once dependencies are installed, run:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```
